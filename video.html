            <h2>Video One</h2>
            <p>This video was taken during a Community Ed class. Our topic for the day was going to the bank and in this video, we learned and practiced vocabulary words used in banking. It was an integrated-skills class.</p>

            <h2>Video Two</h2>
            <p>This video was taken during the same Community Ed class as above right after we practiced the new vocabulary. We discussed banking in order to prepare the students for a role-play. We decided together on the issue and I guided them through a role-play before I asked them to act it out.</p>

            <h2>Video Three</h2>
            <p>This was an Intensive English class with advanced speakers. It was a Listening/Speaking class where the students were preparing to attend an English-Speaking University. The topic of the day was making predictions. We first talked about the definition of prediction, and then practiced together with a story.</p>
